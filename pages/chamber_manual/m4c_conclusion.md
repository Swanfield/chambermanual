## Conclusion.

It is very important that the centre keeps the systems in a 100% serviceable condition, The Air and the Oxygen are married together in pressure, this has been pointed out as you read this manual, So the Air Filters MUST be kept clean and free from ALL contaminates, Oxygen Filters MUST be kept open or the patients will suffer Items of equipment should not be replaced by other types, if the replacement is not compatible with the system, So a full working knowledge of the complete system is very important, Remember the Oxygen Demand Valves optimum working pressure is the lynch pin that the complete system is governed by.

Keeping the servicing of the system on time, spacing the visits to about 10 months to 1 year is about the correct gap, about this time items are showing signs of wear and should be replaced, Remember that the complete system costs between £52,000.00. up to £73,000.00. to replace, if it isn't serviceable it's a complete waste of money, the smooth running of the system gives the patients peace of mind, If the equipment starts giving problems some people get very worried to the point where their treatment becomes null and void, then the centre starts loosing patients = revenue.

All the systems are very robust and will work for years with the minimum of service but that is no way to care for an expensive item.
