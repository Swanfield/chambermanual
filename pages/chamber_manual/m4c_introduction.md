## Overview

The bases for a new manual for the 

# Original Manual

## The Oxygen System

The start of the system can begin with either the HP. Cylinder or the LOX. (liquid oxygen.) Tank.

The difference between the two systems is pressure of the supplied gas. The 'J' type cylinder comes to the centre with approx 1800 psi. of Oxygen pressure and the amount is 6800.Ltrs. weight of the cylinder is 152 lbs.(68.9kg.) empty.

The LOX. Comes into the centre from either a large tank located outside the centre, or from one or two LC.200 Mini LOX tanks that can be located within the buildings Oxygen store (these tanks will hold approx 18 cylinders of HP. Oxygen each), this store must have plenty of ventilation, The reason is, if the Oxygen leaks from the vessel it will lie on the floor for quite some time prior to mixing back into the atmosphere. Therefore this could be a potential hazard.

The Oxygen that is supplied from the supplier is clean, the storage vessels sometimes are not clean, this fouling will be moved by the oxygen down the line onto the seats of the regulators and valve seatings, So in the line are Sintered Bronze filters these become blocked and require replacing during servicing of the system.

In some LOX systems it has been found that 50 micron filters had to be fitted to catch all the fouling moving through the system, so if these systems are ignored and the fouling is allowed to build up then this will damage the Demand Valve seating and slow down the oxygen delivery rate. The damaged valve seat will 'dump' oxygen into the chamber and the Analyser will detect this making problems for the operator.

## Murex Racking.

This is the racking that the HP. Cylinders are stored in, it consists of very thick walled copper piping (Tested to 425 Bar.) (6375psi) and a number of Non - Return Valves plus pigtails, the seal between the pigtail and the cylinder is obtained by the use of the Bodok Seal. During routine servicing all the NRV's are stripped and replaced if signs of damage are present, Pigtails are examined for damaged and over bending, the Bodok Seals are all replaced.

## Main Block.

The main block is located in the centre of the racking, this is the mounting for the oxygen regulator, within the main block will be found the main shut off / on taps, These taps are made from Stainless Steel, in time the S/S shaft cuts the brass block threads and the only repair possible is 'Replacement' of the complete block. Leaks will occur around the caps, ONLY 'nip up' the cap as over tightening will destroy the PTFE. Liner. 

If leaks appear around the base of the tap, where it is secured to the main block, the 'O' ring will need to be replaced, these 'O' rings are a Murex special size and need to be stocked.

## How to Use the Oxygen Racking.

The correct use of the Oxygen racking is, at the start of the first dive of the day open all the cylinders on the racking when this has been done the twin control knobs located in the centre of the racking are then the main controls, close down one side using the control knob. This side then becomes your reserve. The open side will be used by the patients and the falling pressure will monitored by the operator at the control panel, bearing in mind the two working pressures for the Demand Valves (Drager & Scott) the (LP.) needle on the Panel will bob up and down during use. Let the pressure drop approximately from 110psi. (Drager) to say 80 psi then OPEN the second control valve (reserve) the pressure returns to full working pressure and the used cylinders can then be closed and replaced with full cylinders. The reason for using this method is so ALL cylinders are returned to BOC empty and not with useable oxygen still contained inside the cylinder.

Remember any 'J' cylinders containing say 300psi. of oxygen will keep one patient breathing for approximately 15mins, a bank of cylinders will keep 3 or 4 patients happy for half a dive, so don't be to hasty to replace the cylinders, get your money's worth from them, BOC doesn't give refunds.

## The Oxygen Regulator.

This particular type of regulator is used on the Murex Racking as the 'outgoing' pressure can be set to 1000 psi. if required, it is normally set at 500 psi. (Do not fit BOC Saffire as the 'outgoing1 pressure is insufficient) This is so the main oxygen pipe acts as a storage to the Control Panel but also limits the amount of oxygen within the building, in the event of a fire in the centre the oxygen content is very small.

Any other regulator that is fitted to replace the 7000 Series. Never has the correct 'outgoing' pressure, this will effect the amount of Oxygen that the patients receive, in some cases insufficient oxygen was provided and the patients failed to get any benefit.

Servicing of the 7000 series regulator, the unit must be stripped right down and cleaned using 'trie' or some other cleaner, this will remove any oil based fouling, all 'O' rings are to be replaced and the 'cone' filter in the bullnose mounting. Lubricate using Silicone oil or (Crystallube) only. Reassemble and return it to the main block, tighten down then check for any leaks. 

## Copper Piping.

On the HP. Systems 3/8 bore piping is adequate in size to supply all the patients needs, If the centre changes over to LP. Oxygen then the pipe ID. Must be increased to make sure that there will be sufficient oxygen readily available for the patients needs. In the use of LOX the pipe size should be increased to 22mm right up to the back of the panel.

All copper pipe used is manufactured to BS. 2871 Pt. 1. Table X. and the quality systems in accordance with EN 29002/ISO 9002.

## The Compressor & the Air Receiver Tank.

### Types of compressors.

The types of compressors that can be used are as follows:- 
 Reciprocal,
 Sliding Vane or 
 Screw.

Reciprocal compressors are noisy, old fashioned and make a lot of vibration, but do tend to run for years, During every service the oil has to be changed, this is to remove the oil contamination from the moving parts.

The Sliding Vane is the Hydrovane designed compressor, a continuously running machine, quiet (65db) no vibration, this machine will run on the same oil for 2000 hours, (it likes to run) it can be either single phase or three phase, Three phase motors will produce bigger compressors with more air output. The 501 & 502 units must be allowed to run for at least 25 mins each time they are started or the operator will find the oil becoming emulsified.

Screw compressors are usually fully silenced housed in module boxes, these machines are higher priced then the others but well worth the money. Again the oil can be used over & over again for 2000 running hours. These compressors are small in physical size but very high in Air output. The Screw compressor usually costs more then the other two types.

What ever type of compressor the centre decides to purchase, check with the installer of the equipment to ensure that the output pressure of the compressor is compatible with the system.

In all cases, any maintenance of the compressor, the manufactures handbook must be used for guidance for spare parts and specifications on lubricants and torque loadings. 

## Pressure Switch.

The pressure switch is the 'brain' that turns the compressor on /off. This piece of equipment is designed to operate at two set pressures. Low pressure being the time to switch the compressor on, when working pressure is reached it will switch the compressor off. This will make the compressor fully automatic, so it can be safely left switch ON at all times.

All the mains cables entering this unit must be fully insulated and tight on the terminals, the earthing must be 100% correct using the right size earth wire (10mm) Any broken cable fittings must be replaced at once.

A visual inspection of the complete cable run must be carried out during every service, or at least once a year. This is one of items that the inspection services are very 'hot' on.

## The Pressure Relief Valve.

The pressure relief valve is a vital safety feature for the Receiver Tank, this valve must be inspected on every service, cleaned and exercised to ensure freedom of movement. Any faults found MUST be dealt with immediately.

## Pressure Gauge.

The pressure gauge is fitted to the Air Receiver to show if the vessel has pressure inside of it. This is a safety feature for the engineer that is going to work on it. So once again if it is found to be defective, it must be replaced as soon as possible.

## Air Receiver Tank.

The Air Receiver Tank will be either a horizontal mounted or vertical standing vessel, holding approx 1000 plus Itrs. Of cold stored air. It will be constructed to BS5169, 1992, Class 111, Grade 'E'

It is best if the tank could stand outside the building in the fresh air, this will ensure the low temperature of the stored air, this will add to the patients comfort when the dive is taking place.

The tank must be kept in a good state of repair, ie. Painted and free from rust, the tank will be inspected every two years by the Insurance company, this will be an internal inspection and metal thickness test. Any deterioration of the tank could mean its replacement by a new vessel. Remember the size of the Air Receiver is very important, the bigger the better, it's cheaper to buy a Receiver Tank then a compressor and it's the storage of cold air that's important to the patients, not how fast you can replace it with the size of the compressor.

## The Drain Tap.

The Drain Tap located at the base of the Air Receiver, this tap is for the draining off of water, this water is made by the compressor during the making of compressed air, the water must be drained off daily if possible, but once a week is the longest that it can be left. If the tank has a lot of water inside of it this will be moved down the line to the Air Filters, this will shorten the elements life, remember if the tank has a lot of water in it there's no room for the Air.

When draining the water off, open the tap very very slowly, when the water starts to flow stop opening the valve, wait until the water stops and the air starts to come out, Close the tap.

## Air Filters & the Regulators.

### Types of Air Filters.

The types of Medical breathing filters that are being used in the M.S. Centres around Gt. Britain are as follows:-

Domnick Hunter, Compair Broomwade, Ultra Filter, Norgren, Asco- Joucomatic to name but a few, they all work the same, filtering out the impurities from the air that the patients are breathing inside the chamber. Remember the air inside the Air Receiver cannot be breathed until it has been filtered. It is required that the filters have three bowls attached to them, ie. Pre-filter, Coalescing filter, Carbon filter. This makes for Breathing Air Filters, No other configuration of filters is acceptable.

 Pre - Element Filter, this filter removes the solids and water from the air plus some oil.
 Coalescing Filter, this filter removes the remaining water but mainly oil from the air. (hydrocarbons)
 Carbon Filter, this filter is located at the end of the line and removes odour from the air making it odourless to the patients inside the chamber.

Mounted at the end of the three filters you will find an Air Regulator, this piece of equipment regulates the air pressure being released from the Air Receiver, it will be at the same pressure as the optimum working pressure of the Oxygen demand valves.

This will ensure that in the event of a fire the Air /Oxy change over will go unnoticed by the patients.

In the base of each filter bowl is mounted an Air Auto Drain, this little unit will dump the build up of water inside the bowl as and when it reaches a certain level, this ensures that the elements will work in the best environment to prolong their working life. Temperature plays a big part in prolonging their working life, ie. Keep them cold.

To get the best from your filters, ensure that the filters are large in size* this will guarantee maximum air movement and long life.

### The life of yourfilters:-

 Pre-filter element, This element will last quite a long time as the air flow through the Mesh is unrestricted, so it could last several years.
 Coalescing Element. This element is the main workhorse of the system it filters out most of the impurities its working life is governed by the air flow through it, this will be either 6000 hrs. or when it takes between 6 to 10 psi. to blow through it, one year in the system or when the sponge on the element is socked with oil.
 Carbon Element. This element removes oil vapour and or odours using an activated Carbon its life is very similar to the Coalescing element as they work hand in glove.

Because the air system is interconnected with the Oxygen system, in the event of a fire or the use of the Air/Oxy lever being used during treatment, if the filters are not up to standard then the patients will breath in the HYDROCARBON VAPOURS" and this would aggravate the patients problems, also in extreme cases where the filter system has reached saturation point and the elements still have not been changed, oil has been seen running down the chamber wall. If the Air/Oxy lever had been used, oxygen would have been introduced into the airline with dramatic results.

## Molykote.

All the threads on the elements and the filter bowls should be lubricated using a grease that is compatible with breathing air, that grease is Molykote 33 medium this grease consists of Silicone Oil, Lithium Soap and conforms to ISO 2137 260-300 this grease has good oxidation stability low evaporation rate = long term / lifetime lubrication, DN value 350.000 and the temperature range is -73 to +180 degrees C. it prevents rust from forming on the steel threads and aids in the assembly and servicing of the Air Filters.
