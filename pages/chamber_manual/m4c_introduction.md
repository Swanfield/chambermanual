## Overview

The bases for a new manual for the 

# Original Manual

## The Oxygen System

The start of the system can begin with either the HP. Cylinder or the LOX. (liquid oxygen.) Tank.

The difference between the two systems is pressure of the supplied gas. The 'J' type cylinder comes to the centre with approx 1800 psi. of Oxygen pressure and the amount is 6800.Ltrs. weight of the cylinder is 152 lbs.(68.9kg.) empty.

The LOX. Comes into the centre from either a large tank located outside the centre, or from one or two LC.200 Mini LOX tanks that can be located within the buildings Oxygen store (these tanks will hold approx 18 cylinders of HP. Oxygen each), this store must have plenty of ventilation, The reason is, if the Oxygen leaks from the vessel it will lie on the floor for quite some time prior to mixing back into the atmosphere. Therefore this could be a potential hazard.

The Oxygen that is supplied from the supplier is clean, the storage vessels sometimes are not clean, this fouling will be moved by the oxygen down the line onto the seats of the regulators and valve seatings, So in the line are Sintered Bronze filters these become blocked and require replacing during servicing of the system.

In some LOX systems it has been found that 50 micron filters had to be fitted to catch all the fouling moving through the system, so if these systems are ignored and the fouling is allowed to build up then this will damage the Demand Valve seating and slow down the oxygen delivery rate. The damaged valve seat will 'dump' oxygen into the chamber and the Analyser will detect this making problems for the operator.

## Murex Racking.

This is the racking that the HP. Cylinders are stored in, it consists of very thick walled copper piping (Tested to 425 Bar.) (6375psi) and a number of Non - Return Valves plus pigtails, the seal between the pigtail and the cylinder is obtained by the use of the Bodok Seal. During routine servicing all the NRV's are stripped and replaced if signs of damage are present, Pigtails are examined for damaged and over bending, the Bodok Seals are all replaced.

## Main Block.

The main block is located in the centre of the racking, this is the mounting for the oxygen regulator, within the main block will be found the main shut off / on taps, These taps are made from Stainless Steel, in time the S/S shaft cuts the brass block threads and the only repair possible is 'Replacement' of the complete block. Leaks will occur around the caps, ONLY 'nip up' the cap as over tightening will destroy the PTFE. Liner. 

If leaks appear around the base of the tap, where it is secured to the main block, the 'O' ring will need to be replaced, these 'O' rings are a Murex special size and need to be stocked.

## How to Use the Oxygen Racking.

The correct use of the Oxygen racking is, at the start of the first dive of the day open all the cylinders on the racking when this has been done the twin control knobs located in the centre of the racking are then the main controls, close down one side using the control knob. This side then becomes your reserve. The open side will be used by the patients and the falling pressure will monitored by the operator at the control panel, bearing in mind the two working pressures for the Demand Valves (Drager & Scott) the (LP.) needle on the Panel will bob up and down during use. Let the pressure drop approximately from 110psi. (Drager) to say 80 psi then OPEN the second control valve (reserve) the pressure returns to full working pressure and the used cylinders can then be closed and replaced with full cylinders. The reason for using this method is so ALL cylinders are returned to BOC empty and not with useable oxygen still contained inside the cylinder.

Remember any 'J' cylinders containing say 300psi. of oxygen will keep one patient breathing for approximately 15mins, a bank of cylinders will keep 3 or 4 patients happy for half a dive, so don't be to hasty to replace the cylinders, get your money's worth from them, BOC doesn't give refunds.

## The Oxygen Regulator.

This particular type of regulator is used on the Murex Racking as the 'outgoing' pressure can be set to 1000 psi. if required, it is normally set at 500 psi. (Do not fit BOC Saffire as the 'outgoing1 pressure is insufficient) This is so the main oxygen pipe acts as a storage to the Control Panel but also limits the amount of oxygen within the building, in the event of a fire in the centre the oxygen content is very small.

Any other regulator that is fitted to replace the 7000 Series. Never has the correct 'outgoing' pressure, this will effect the amount of Oxygen that the patients receive, in some cases insufficient oxygen was provided and the patients failed to get any benefit.

Servicing of the 7000 series regulator, the unit must be stripped right down and cleaned using 'trie' or some other cleaner, this will remove any oil based fouling, all 'O' rings are to be replaced and the 'cone' filter in the bullnose mounting. Lubricate using Silicone oil or (Crystallube) only. Reassemble and return it to the main block, tighten down then check for any leaks. 

## Copper Piping.

On the HP. Systems 3/8 bore piping is adequate in size to supply all the patients needs, If the centre changes over to LP. Oxygen then the pipe ID. Must be increased to make sure that there will be sufficient oxygen readily available for the patients needs. In the use of LOX the pipe size should be increased to 22mm right up to the back of the panel.

All copper pipe used is manufactured to BS. 2871 Pt. 1. Table X. and the quality systems in accordance with EN 29002/ISO 9002.

## The Compressor & the Air Receiver Tank.

### Types of compressors.

The types of compressors that can be used are as follows:- 
 Reciprocal,
 Sliding Vane or 
 Screw.

Reciprocal compressors are noisy, old fashioned and make a lot of vibration, but do tend to run for years, During every service the oil has to be changed, this is to remove the oil contamination from the moving parts.

The Sliding Vane is the Hydrovane designed compressor, a continuously running machine, quiet (65db) no vibration, this machine will run on the same oil for 2000 hours, (it likes to run) it can be either single phase or three phase, Three phase motors will produce bigger compressors with more air output. The 501 & 502 units must be allowed to run for at least 25 mins each time they are started or the operator will find the oil becoming emulsified.

Screw compressors are usually fully silenced housed in module boxes, these machines are higher priced then the others but well worth the money. Again the oil can be used over & over again for 2000 running hours. These compressors are small in physical size but very high in Air output. The Screw compressor usually costs more then the other two types.

What ever type of compressor the centre decides to purchase, check with the installer of the equipment to ensure that the output pressure of the compressor is compatible with the system.

In all cases, any maintenance of the compressor, the manufactures handbook must be used for guidance for spare parts and specifications on lubricants and torque loadings. 

## Pressure Switch.

The pressure switch is the 'brain' that turns the compressor on /off. This piece of equipment is designed to operate at two set pressures. Low pressure being the time to switch the compressor on, when working pressure is reached it will switch the compressor off. This will make the compressor fully automatic, so it can be safely left switch ON at all times.

All the mains cables entering this unit must be fully insulated and tight on the terminals, the earthing must be 100% correct using the right size earth wire (10mm) Any broken cable fittings must be replaced at once.

A visual inspection of the complete cable run must be carried out during every service, or at least once a year. This is one of items that the inspection services are very 'hot' on.

## The Pressure Relief Valve.

The pressure relief valve is a vital safety feature for the Receiver Tank, this valve must be inspected on every service, cleaned and exercised to ensure freedom of movement. Any faults found MUST be dealt with immediately.

## Pressure Gauge.

The pressure gauge is fitted to the Air Receiver to show if the vessel has pressure inside of it. This is a safety feature for the engineer that is going to work on it. So once again if it is found to be defective, it must be replaced as soon as possible.

## Air Receiver Tank.

The Air Receiver Tank will be either a horizontal mounted or vertical standing vessel, holding approx 1000 plus Itrs. Of cold stored air. It will be constructed to BS5169, 1992, Class 111, Grade 'E'

It is best if the tank could stand outside the building in the fresh air, this will ensure the low temperature of the stored air, this will add to the patients comfort when the dive is taking place.

The tank must be kept in a good state of repair, ie. Painted and free from rust, the tank will be inspected every two years by the Insurance company, this will be an internal inspection and metal thickness test. Any deterioration of the tank could mean its replacement by a new vessel. Remember the size of the Air Receiver is very important, the bigger the better, it's cheaper to buy a Receiver Tank then a compressor and it's the storage of cold air that's important to the patients, not how fast you can replace it with the size of the compressor.

## The Drain Tap.

The Drain Tap located at the base of the Air Receiver, this tap is for the draining off of water, this water is made by the compressor during the making of compressed air, the water must be drained off daily if possible, but once a week is the longest that it can be left. If the tank has a lot of water inside of it this will be moved down the line to the Air Filters, this will shorten the elements life, remember if the tank has a lot of water in it there's no room for the Air.

When draining the water off, open the tap very very slowly, when the water starts to flow stop opening the valve, wait until the water stops and the air starts to come out, Close the tap.

## Air Filters & the Regulators.

### Types of Air Filters.

The types of Medical breathing filters that are being used in the M.S. Centres around Gt. Britain are as follows:-

Domnick Hunter, Compair Broomwade, Ultra Filter, Norgren, Asco- Joucomatic to name but a few, they all work the same, filtering out the impurities from the air that the patients are breathing inside the chamber. Remember the air inside the Air Receiver cannot be breathed until it has been filtered. It is required that the filters have three bowls attached to them, ie. Pre-filter, Coalescing filter, Carbon filter. This makes for Breathing Air Filters, No other configuration of filters is acceptable.

 Pre - Element Filter, this filter removes the solids and water from the air plus some oil.
 Coalescing Filter, this filter removes the remaining water but mainly oil from the air. (hydrocarbons)
 Carbon Filter, this filter is located at the end of the line and removes odour from the air making it odourless to the patients inside the chamber.

Mounted at the end of the three filters you will find an Air Regulator, this piece of equipment regulates the air pressure being released from the Air Receiver, it will be at the same pressure as the optimum working pressure of the Oxygen demand valves.

This will ensure that in the event of a fire the Air /Oxy change over will go unnoticed by the patients.

In the base of each filter bowl is mounted an Air Auto Drain, this little unit will dump the build up of water inside the bowl as and when it reaches a certain level, this ensures that the elements will work in the best environment to prolong their working life. Temperature plays a big part in prolonging their working life, ie. Keep them cold.

To get the best from your filters, ensure that the filters are large in size* this will guarantee maximum air movement and long life.

### The life of yourfilters:-

 Pre-filter element, This element will last quite a long time as the air flow through the Mesh is unrestricted, so it could last several years.
 Coalescing Element. This element is the main workhorse of the system it filters out most of the impurities its working life is governed by the air flow through it, this will be either 6000 hrs. or when it takes between 6 to 10 psi. to blow through it, one year in the system or when the sponge on the element is socked with oil.
 Carbon Element. This element removes oil vapour and or odours using an activated Carbon its life is very similar to the Coalescing element as they work hand in glove.

Because the air system is interconnected with the Oxygen system, in the event of a fire or the use of the Air/Oxy lever being used during treatment, if the filters are not up to standard then the patients will breath in the HYDROCARBON VAPOURS" and this would aggravate the patients problems, also in extreme cases where the filter system has reached saturation point and the elements still have not been changed, oil has been seen running down the chamber wall. If the Air/Oxy lever had been used, oxygen would have been introduced into the airline with dramatic results.

## Molykote.

All the threads on the elements and the filter bowls should be lubricated using a grease that is compatible with breathing air, that grease is Molykote 33 medium this grease consists of Silicone Oil, Lithium Soap and conforms to ISO 2137 260-300 this grease has good oxidation stability low evaporation rate = long term / lifetime lubrication, DN value 350.000 and the temperature range is -73 to +180 degrees C. it prevents rust from forming on the steel threads and aids in the assembly and servicing of the Air Filters. 

## THE CHAMBER.

Manufactured to BS 5500: 1999 Cat 2. with a Design Pressure of 33ft. (2 ats) the Test Pressure of 66ft. (3 ats.)

## Chamber Types.

Regardless of chamber size or type the basic system remains the same, the only slight difference would be the single chamber with no water deluge, all the others work the same, the complete system revolves around the compressor and the Oxygen demand valves.

## Chamber Door.

The entrance door to the chamber is the only moving part to the chamber, it must swing freely on it's hinges. The doors are mounted on roller bearings so will move very easily, the door must meet the frame squarely and the rubber sealing face or 'O' ring is of the utmost importance, all seals must be kept in a good state of repair, either oiled or powered, French Chalk will keep the seal in a lasting good state and will not be removed by the patients clothes as they pass through the doorway.

## L.B. 78. Overboard Dumps, (comex pro)

The L.B. 78 is the method that is used to expel the used Oxygen from the chamber to the outside atmosphere, Servicing of this item is again important, if the 'dump' fails then the pressurisation of the chamber will not take place as all the air will be discharged to the outside of the building. If this does occur during a dive turn the ball valve OFF this is located just above the 'dump' on the pipework.

All the 'dumps' in the chamber should be serviced at the very least once a year, they need to be stripped down to the last piece and all the 'O' rings replaced, the moving parts lubricated with silicone oil/grease (crystallube) The large diaphragm needs to be inspected for profile, the oxygen makes the 'Nitrile' grow, if this has taken place the replacement of the diaphragm into the 'dump is almost impossible. Lastly the corrugated hose requires to be inspected for damaged and 'ageing'. The 'O' ring on the pvc. Tube needs to be replaced annually or oxygen will leak into the chamber during use.

One last item, when the L.B. 78 Overboard Dump is fitted in the system it's essential that the patients mask is fitted with a non-return valve, if this isn't done then the patient will breath in more 'air' then 'oxygen'. The safety feature in the rear of the dump is the mushroom flap valve, this is where the air will enter the system.

## Scott Exhaust Valve.

The Scott Exhaust Valve is manufactured by the Americans and is the most successful dump, easy to install almost maintenance free and the internal working parts go on for ever, It works on exactly the same principal as the Comex pro but better, this unit will last for years. Servicing the 'Scott' use the same lubricants as used on the Comex pro. Make sure that the conical spring is correctly seated.

## Demand Valves.

The Drager Demand Valve and the Scott Demand Valve work in exactly the same way, both have 'tilt valves' & 'LP\ Seats, the only difference is the Drager can be repaired on site quite cheaply where's the Scott is repaired by replacement, this makes the Scott the more expensive of the two. The working pressures of both valves are different, the Drager Valve has a working pressure of 110psi. the Scott Valve has a working pressure of 65 psi + 15 psi over ambient, so the valve is set to 80psi and this will cover the range required for all M.S. & C.P. Chambers.

The Scott Valve comes fitted with a free flow device as standard; the Drager can be fitted with the same device.

## Pipe Specifications.

The Oxygen rubber pipe that comes from the chamber wall to the Demand Valve is manufactured to a very high standard. The Standard is EN559. It is both Abrasion and Weather Resistant, the branding on the outside of the pipe will read (on the latest piping) EN559 2 Mpa (20bar) Size DH year of Manufacture. The reinforcement of the pipe is High Tensile Synthetic Textile Plies. The Safety Factor is rated at 3:1 Minimum. The WP. 20 Bar. (300psi) the BP. 60 bar. (900 psi)

## Chamber Seating.

The seating in the chambers has come on since the first one was made, All seats fitted are High Backed with Armrests so that the patient can relax and get the best from the treatment. Also seat belts can be fitted if required this will prevent the patient falling from the chair. The seating should be inspected on each service and all nuts and bolts checked of security, it is the centres duty to keep the seating up to a high standard as the patient uses the chair for at least 1.5 hrs. each dive. 

## Silencers.

The colourful plastic silences inside the chamber are very important in reducing the noise of the air during an ascent or dive, without these being fitted the noise would be unbearable, these silences do become blocked and require replacing, otherwise they will restrict air flow and could become a hazard. When the internal pressure to blow through them is greater then 3 to 4psi. time to change.

## Sight Glasses and Ports.

The sight glasses and ports are to be checked for serviceability, ie. Cracking or distortion and that the internal bolts are secure, A full test by pressurising the chamber until the pressure relief valve lifts then check for any leaks from the gaskets. This test is always recorded on the service sheet. The rubber gaskets should be checked / replaced every 10-12 years. The glass ports are toughened glass and pressure designed to withstand 165 fhsw as we use glass and not acrylic the glasses always remain the same size for life, the acrylic lenses tend to 'grow' in diameter and then make groaning noises during diving operations, this noise tends to worry the patients and the centre personal, it can be corrected.

## The Hy-lift Safety Relief Valve.

This Valve has been designed by National Vulcan and is very successful relief valve, the valve is designed to slowly lift until the pressure reaches the full lift point where the valve will spring wide and discharge the air pressure faster then it can be introduced to the pressure vessel. The air pressure will fall quickly until the valve will then snap shut and seal it's self. The full lift pressure is recorded on the service sheet every time a full service is carried out.

## The Water Sprinkler Head.

The Sprinkler Head is mounted in the centre of the dishend inside the chamber. In the event of a chamber fire the water discharged via this head will strike the chamber wall approx 2" above the weld seam, all the patients would be soaked to the skin in approx 10 seconds. 

## The Control Panel.

## Air Taps and the pipework.

The Peglar Air Taps are to be stripped and the 'O' rings replaced and lubricated using an air silicone grease. Check all the joints for leaks, tighten up the fittings if required. If the taps start to let air past it has been found in the past that they are not being turned off tight enough, 'nip' the tap closed this will force the wedge into the seat, and clean away any small debris on the face of the valve.

The Air Receiver Gauge this gauge will show you the pressure in the air receiver, you will not get a correct gauge reading whilst air is being removed from the tank, To check on the tanks content the air inlet tap on the panel must be turned off.

The Therapeutic Depth Gauge, this gauge is very accurate and will measure down to feet / inches / Bar on it's dual scale. It must be checked for freedom of movement both up and down the scale, the lubrication of this gauge is not allowed, if the incorrect oil is used it will 'stick' the movement up and make the action "jumpy' Do not tap the glass, tap the panel if needed. Remember this gauge costs £543.00 so don't abuse it.

The Analyser and the Bobbin Flow Meter is to be inspected for serviceability by checking that with the sensor removed the L.C.D. reads 000 with the sensor fitted it reads 21% if it fails the test, check the battery state (101 D2 can not be checked in this way) The life of the Cell is now approx 18 mths. to 2 years. Never try to calibrate the Analyser if the battery hasn't got a full charge. The Bobbin Flow Meter is set to 2 Lpm. This will give the unit just a 'sniff any more will give an inaccurate reading. The Analyser can be left on ALL the time if you like, it will NOT effect the life of the cell as the moment the cell is removed from the Nitrogen filled bag the clock is ticking on it's life, (see the sheet marked Analyser Check List.)

The Radio system if fitted, all the wiring is to be inspected for state of repair, all speaker switches checked if found to be u/s replace with good quality switches,

The headphones in the chamber have a life, replace when they are damaged, spares should be stocked. For the Patients peace of mind it could be pointed that the radio wires only carry mini voltage, ie. Decibels of sound.

The Oxygen Shutoff Valve the main 02 tap is removed from the panel stripped, cleaned, lubricated using 'Crystallube' reassembled and refitted to the panel, when all the joints are tightened they must be inspected for any leaks. The 'O' rings in. the shutoff valve are 'viton' not 'nitrile', these are to be replaced on each service.

The 5209 PM. Oxygen Regulator this particular regulator is fitted, as the incoming pressure can be as high as 3000 psi. and the outgoing pressure set as high as 250psi. this makes this regulator unique, most BOC regulators only work to 'low' out going pressures. This 'reg.' is removed from the panel stripped and cleaned using 'trie', a new 'O' ring is fitted plus the HP. Seat (which is rubber faced) and end fitting, lubricated using 'Crystallube' then reassemble and replace in the panel, check all joints for leaks. The Safety Valves fitted in the system are to protect the Demand Valve inside the chamber. Check these by lifting the central shaft to make certain that they move freely.

The Oxygen Gauges mounted on the panel are specially designed gauges, they have 'blow out' plugs on the back and only this type can be used with Oxygen. On the panel are two gauges one will read the incoming 02 pressure and the other reads the pressure being supplied to the patients via the 5209 P.M. Oxygen Regulator.

The Intercom this is a 'hard wire' unit into the chamber, runs on mains power stepped down to 9 volts on the master side, and only reading decibels inside the chamber on the 'slave'. So there is no way that this unit could ever cause a problem on safety in the chamber.

The Count Down Timer is the little unit is for the convenience of the operator in the timing of the dive.

The Water Deluge Controls. They consist of the P.M. 'Legris' Ball Valve and the Martinair Spool Valve. The ball valve is operated every time the centre has a service and the water discharged outside the building, it is then reset and 'tied' back into place. The Spool Valve is the link between the Air system and the Oxygen system, in the event of the 'fire' this lever is operated and the Oxygen is shut down and the Air turned on. This valve must be stripped every service and all the 'O' rings replaced or leakage can be experienced across into the Oxygen System, this will be noticed by the pressure creeping up even though the oxygen is shut off. Clean internally using 'trie', lubricate using 'crystallube'.

## The Water Deluge System.

### Operating Instructions.

In the event of a fire in the chamber the system is designed to drench the occupants with water. There is also a facility to change the breathing 'Gas' from Oxygen to Air. Remember this complete system is Manually operated and not Automatic, So all operators will have to familiarise themselves with the system

Daily Check the following Items:

 1.	Water level in the receiver tank.
 2.	The Air Pressure in the tank, this should read approx 110psi. If the pressure is low, increase the pressure by using the Air Control Valve, this is located on the left- hand side of the tank.  Do not forget to close the valve after adjusting the air pressure.

 3.	Air Control Valve is in the closed position.

The system relies on the operator being fully conversant on what action to take in the event of a fire. The following procedure should be practised ( without actually operating the system) over and over again until it becomes an automatic action.

 1.	Turn the Water Deluge lever down. (Don't break the tie.)
 2.	Pull down the Air / Oxy. Lever. (Don't break the tie.)
 3.	Making sure the door locks are off. Open ALL the exhausts and bring the patients to the surface.
 4.	Evacuate the centre.

************************************

The Water Tank This vessel is Hot Dipped Galvanised (H & SE instructions 1986) it has a working pressure of 16 bar.(240psi) Even though the pressure only ever goes to 110psi. so it is well within the pressure range of the centre's compressor.

The Pressure Relief Valve this is a Truset valve set to 150psi. this is exercised on each service and checked by the inspecting authority. (National Vulcan. Zurich Engineering, British Engine)

The Sight Glass this is the name given to the see through pipe on the side of the tank, it shows the operator the water level inside the tank. It will remain at a constant level.

The Ball Valves these are the control valves which control the water and the air inside the tank, also the delivery of the water to the control panel, all the piping is now installed using copper this reduces corrosion to nil.

## The Internal Lighting.

The Internal Lighting is located in the roof of the chamber or mounted high on the chamber wall, it is 2 x SP 279 lights producing between the pair 150 Watts of light using approx 14 Watts actual. The lighting controls terminate at the control panel.

## The construction spec.

The Bulkhead Light 279 -IP65. Butyl Rubber Body with Polycarbonate Dome. The 2 x PL 7 Watt lamps produce 75 Watts of light with a burn time of 4000 hrs approx.

The Protection. IP68. With a Max pressure of 4 ats.

The Conduit Standard flexible PVC. Conduit IP65 resistant to Water / Dust /Self extinguishing UL94VO. Temperature range:-15 to 65 degrees. Crush resistant to BS 4607. UV resistant.

The Cable Manufactured to BS 6500. 1.5mm 15 Amp BICC.

During a service the Bowls are removed and polished clean, checked for cracks and ageing, the two PL. tubes must be replaced or they will not last a further year in service. No. 84 tubes should be used for brightness.

It has been proven that the lighting control gear has a working life and it has been decided that the control gear will be replaced at five-year intervals; this will take place during a full service of the system.

The complete Internal Lighting System has been inspected and passed by the H&SE in 2000. Providing the system is inspected on annual bases they cannot foresee any ensuing problems. Also the system can be upgraded if required during any service.

## The Internal Cooling Fans.

The Cooling Fans are mounted on the wall or Portholes inside the chamber;

12 volts DC power them. Which means that the motor is two magnets attracting to each other on rotation, this makes the Fan unit intrinsically safe, all the wiring is made to BS 6500. And is earthed at source.

The fans can be set to oscillate on a continuous setting or fixed into one direction at the flick of a switch, it's the patients choice.

The Power Pack that runs them is located behind the control panel, 240 volt fused 3 amp AC. Being turned into 12volts DC. To run the units. The switches that control the fans are located on the control panel and managed by the operator.

The wiring of the fans albeit 12 volts must be inspected on a daily/weekiy bases to ensure that the 'joins1 in the wires, (the Lucar connectors) are covered by the silicone see through covers, if the bare copper ends come into contact with the chamber wall the fan will be damaged internally by shorting out back to the Power Pack, this is the job of the chamber operator to inspect the system.

## Face Masks, Hoods, Mouthpieces & Full Face Masks,

### Types,

There are several different types of masks on the market they are Drager, Baxter, Kermira Rubber, Kermira Silicone, North, Small Scott, Sabra Gemini, (silicone.) They have been in service for about 17 years, each centre has it's own choice, some patients use the Mouthpiece and find it to their liking. There is also the Full Face Mask for the patient that can not either:- find a 14 mask to suit or the patient that has the 'shakes' this FFM. Will not fall off once fitted correctly.

The small children can only use the Hood because of the size of their heads plus you can't expect a child to wear a 14 mask for any length of time. The types of Hoods on the market that this moment is the the Amron Hood (American).

## Care & Maintenance.

All masks must be washed clean after use, if any washing up liquid is used NO harm will come to the Rubber / Silicone. Washing up liquid contains Tepol. This agent is in all the washing up liquids, it wilt do two things, disinfect the masks and protect the Rubber / Silicone from deterioration, If Milton, Savlon, Hibertone is used you will cause damage to the mask, that will shorten the life of the mask. Just wash the masks in warm soapy water removing sweat & cosmetics hang up to dry and you will get a full life from the materiel.

For Drying, avoid temperatures in excess of 60 C degree.

Masks should always be stored ready for use, ie. Clean, dry, in a dark place and free from any fumes or contaminants.

## Conclusion.

It is very important that the centre keeps the systems in a 100% serviceable condition, The Air and the Oxygen are married together in pressure, this has been pointed out as you read this manual, So the Air Filters MUST be kept clean and free from ALL contaminates, Oxygen Filters MUST be kept open or the patients will suffer Items of equipment should not be replaced by other types, if the replacement is not compatible with the system, So a full working knowledge of the complete system is very important, Remember the Oxygen Demand Valves optimum working pressure is the lynch pin that the complete system is governed by.

Keeping the servicing of the system on time, spacing the visits to about 10 months to 1 year is about the correct gap, about this time items are showing signs of wear and should be replaced, Remember that the complete system costs between £52,000.00. up to £73,000.00. to replace, if it isn't serviceable it's a complete waste of money, the smooth running of the system gives the patients peace of mind, If the equipment starts giving problems some people get very worried to the point where their treatment becomes null and void, then the centre starts loosing patients = revenue.

All the systems are very robust and will work for years with the minimum of service but that is no way to care for an expensive item.
