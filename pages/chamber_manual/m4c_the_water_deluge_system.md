## The Water Deluge System.

### Operating Instructions.

In the event of a fire in the chamber the system is designed to drench the occupants with water. There is also a facility to change the breathing 'Gas' from Oxygen to Air. Remember this complete system is Manually operated and not Automatic, So all operators will have to familiarise themselves with the system

Daily Check the following Items:

 1.	Water level in the receiver tank.
 2.	The Air Pressure in the tank, this should read approx 110psi. If the pressure is low, increase the pressure by using the Air Control Valve, this is located on the left- hand side of the tank.  Do not forget to close the valve after adjusting the air pressure.

 3.	Air Control Valve is in the closed position.

The system relies on the operator being fully conversant on what action to take in the event of a fire. The following procedure should be practised ( without actually operating the system) over and over again until it becomes an automatic action.

 1.	Turn the Water Deluge lever down. (Don't break the tie.)
 2.	Pull down the Air / Oxy. Lever. (Don't break the tie.)
 3.	Making sure the door locks are off. Open ALL the exhausts and bring the patients to the surface.
 4.	Evacuate the centre.

************************************

The Water Tank This vessel is Hot Dipped Galvanised (H & SE instructions 1986) it has a working pressure of 16 bar.(240psi) Even though the pressure only ever goes to 110psi. so it is well within the pressure range of the centre's compressor.

The Pressure Relief Valve this is a Truset valve set to 150psi. this is exercised on each service and checked by the inspecting authority. (National Vulcan. Zurich Engineering, British Engine)

The Sight Glass this is the name given to the see through pipe on the side of the tank, it shows the operator the water level inside the tank. It will remain at a constant level.

The Ball Valves these are the control valves which control the water and the air inside the tank, also the delivery of the water to the control panel, all the piping is now installed using copper this reduces corrosion to nil.
