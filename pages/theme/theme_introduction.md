## Overview

The MS Therapy Centre Lothian uses the [Jekyll Documentation theme](https://swanfield.github.io/manuals/mydoc_introduction.html) with Github Pages to produce manuals and documentation.

Github Pages uses software called Jekyll to produce HTML pages from simple text documents.  The Jekyll Documentation theme adds to this a relatively easy to edit and modify structure that it specifically aimed at producing documentation for both the web and paper (via pdfs).  

The Jekyll Documentation theme provides it's own documentation but it is not always easy to follow for a novice user.  This manual is written specifically with the users of the MSTC in mind and aims to address their specifics needs.  However, if you need it, you can still find the original manual for [the Jekyll Documentation] theme in the drop down menu above (Original Theme Documentation) as it will go over some areas in more detail.

## Survey of features

Some of the more prominent features of this theme include the following:

* Static web pages can be generated and checked before upload to Github,
* The static pages can be converted to pdf documents for printing,
* Multi-level sidebar,
* - Different sidebars for different projects,
* Top navigation bar with drop-down menus,
* Notes, tips, and warning information notes,
* Tags for alternative navigation,
* Advanced landing page layouts from the [Modern Business theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/).

## Introduction to How it Works

Easily produce nice looking documentation by:

* Installing the software,
* Creating simple text documents,
* Committing to Github,
* View on Github Pages.

The software does all the hard work to convert the simple text documents into attractive web pages or practical pdf documents.  The caveat is that the user needs to learn a specific work flow to create and generate these pages.
