# MS Therapy Centre Lothian Manuals

## Introduction

This site contains the manuals created by the MS Therapy Centre Lothian.  The manuals are specific to our situation but other MS therapy centres around the UK use the same or similar components and systems.  It is our hope that making our manuals publicly available (as well as their development and full history through Github) will help others as well as ourselves.

## Available Manuals

### [Oxygem Chamber Manual](m4c_introduction.html)

The [Oxygem Chamber Manual](m4c_introduction.html) details our barochamber system's components and servicing details.

### [Theme Documentation](theme_introduction.html)

The [Theme Documentation](theme_introduction.html) is a modified version of the manual for the "Jekyll Documentation Theme" for github pages that this website uses.  We chose the "Jekyll Documentation Theme" for our manuals because it seemed the easiest way to make a manual that could be written once for both the web and for print.  Using it along with Github makes web deployment a snap with the added benefit of recording changes through Git.  The only disadvantage is the complex setup and learning curve as this isn't just a word document.

### [Original Theme Documentation](mydoc_introduction.html)

The [Original Theme Documentation](mydoc_introduction.html) is also currently available for reference.  This includes sample documents/manuals for [Product 1](p1_landing_page.html) and [Product 2](p2_landing_page.html).
